- # Loops
- There are minaly 3 types of loops
- for loop , while loop , and do while loop
- ## Topics Covered
- for loop
- while loop
- do while loop
- Nested loops
- Loop-based DSA problems
- ## Learning Goals
- Understand how loops work in java
- Solve repetitive problems efficiently
- Build logic using iteration

- ## Notes
All programs include:
- Proper comments
- Beginner-friendly logic
- User input where required
- ### Even_no_1_to_100.java
Logic of this program:
- In this problem we actually print all the numbers which are even upto 100.
- Here we increment by 2 and start from 0 so every step add 2 which is even number.
- ### Table_of_a_Number.java
Logic of this program:
- In this program first we input a number
- Then we use simple for loop concept
- And in for loop we initilze the number which user give us , then in condition part we muliply the input_number*10 , because we want upto 10 ,and increment by this input_number.
- Finally we print the values.
